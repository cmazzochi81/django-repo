What is JSX? JavaScript as XML, allows usage of HTML tags directly in the JavaScript, in the render function. 

Why is using JSX better than create element? Using create element can lead to bugs due to a lot of punctuation, a
as well as potential nesting issues. 

Have to use 'className' as the name of the attribute on a JSX element to include a CSS class. 

What is a component? It is a function that returns an element or a UI interface.   (Equivalent in Django is the views.py file). 

You can use parenthesis () around the return value of function. You can use curly braces {} but if so, 
must use a return statement. 

Component's name, must be capitalized first letter.   

'Props' is an object that contains the properties of the component. You can display dynamic data within a component. 

Props are always passed into component functions. 

You pass in property values in the JSX element in the render function

Destructured means 'props', the properties or specific properties are passed in. 

Use state with events to change the entire application. 

attribute property functions like onClick={this.login} on a button is how you attach functionality to 
UI elements. 

State variables are changed by the functions. 

Use the map function to iterate or map over a const array list. 

When redering a list give each list item a key so React can re-render the list properly. Insert value 'i'
set the value of the key to 'i'.
